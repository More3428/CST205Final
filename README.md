# Future work - We would ideally hope to finish our projecty and add all the features necessary for what we wanted to create.   
#               Which was a project where a user would be able to submit their own picture with a green/blue screen behind it and our
#               program would be able to add a background and if the user wanted a filter over the entire image.
